# nu_MH
Atmospheric Neutrino mass hierarchy project from MINOS

This project was run as part of a much larger code framework at Fermilab.

We ran rungrid.csh, which called rungrid.C, which called ana.C, which did most of the calculation and analysis

The data files produced by ana.C were then processed by plotsensitivity_comb.C to produce the final results.

The pdf file is the conference presentation where I first publicly presented the results of this work.
